# Intended Audience

## End users

End users of this CLI can find a standalone tool on how to supercharge
a Paisano-based project with a TUI/CLI.

In case a framework ships with a branded version, such version is preferable, though.

## Implementers of Paisano-based Frameworks

This repository implements a "raw" version of the Paisano TUI.

Downstream projects, such as [Standard][std] or [Hive][hive] may
however choose to rebrand this tool to offer a seamless and branded
experience to their users.

[std]: https://github.com/divnix/std
[hive]: https://github.com/divnix/hive

Please refer to the readme on how to rebrand.
