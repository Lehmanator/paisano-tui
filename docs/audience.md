# Intended Audience

## End user

End users of this tool can supercharge any Paisano-based project with discoverability.

However, if a framework-specific branded version is available, that should be used instead.

## Framework creator

This repository implements a white-label version of the Paisano repository companion.

Downstream frameworks, such as [Standard][std] or [Hive][hive] can re-brand this tool to offer a seamless and branded experience to their users.

[std]: https://github.com/divnix/std
[hive]: https://github.com/divnix/hive

Please refer to the readme on how to re-brand.
